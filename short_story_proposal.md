# Survey on Facial Expression Short Story Proposal

Facial recognition is a popular topic within the space of neural networks and deep learning. There has been countless research on how to properly identify people’s faces in an image or video and predict different features on their faces. This proposal is to propose to write a short story about a survey on facial expression recognition (source: https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/11/10/1189/htm). The survey provides an overview of the recent advances of facial expression recognition. It discusses the conventional approaches and deep learning-based approaches for facial expression recognition. The short story will be focusing on the deep learning approaches.

In order to supplement the paper’s information for the short story, other surveys explaining facial recognition will be used. In addition, other sources would be used to explain how an effective facial expression recognition model can be created using convolutional neural networks (source: https://www.ijrte.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i4/D8275118419.pdf). 

The proposal for the structure and formatting of the short story starts with the introduction of facial recognition, followed by a brief introduction of computer vision and convolutional neural networks, and then it will discuss existing surveys around facial recognition. During the discussion of the deep learning technologies around facial recognition, the short story will also explain the surveyed models that the sources have used for their research.
